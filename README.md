# stats220

Welcome to my repo. I am a second year biology student at the *University of Auckland*. I am creating this page to display my class work in my statistics class; **stats220**.

My assignment asks that I create the following:
1. meme using R in Rstudio
2. gif using R in Rstudio
3. HTML file

## Assignment criteria
This assignment will help me to learn the following learning outcomes:
- create Rmarkdown files in Rstudio
- write markdown and code chunks
- knitting rmarkdown into HTML

To help me with this assignment, I have found [ this website ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) particularly helpful for finding commands.
